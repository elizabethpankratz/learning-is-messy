# Taxonomies of learning

## Bloom's taxonomy

Probably the most widespread framework for classifying levels of cognition in learning is Bloom's taxonomy [@BloomEtAl1956], more recently refined by @AndersonKrathwohl2001.
Anderson and Krathwohl frame six levels of cognition as actions, here ordered from easiest to most demanding:

- Remember
- Understand
- Apply
- Analyze
- Evaluate
- Create

Each of these actions implicates a different degree of cognitive involvement, but they don't directly describe the kind of connections that the learner is making behind the scenes.
For that reason, Laura prefers to work with the SOLO taxonomy.


## The SOLO taxonomy

SOLO stands for "Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome".
This taxonomy was developed by @BiggsCollis1982, and it specifies five levels of increasingly complex thinking and understanding:

- **Pre-structural:** The learner hasn't started learning.
- **Uni-structural:** The learner can describe an idea or do a single-step procedure.
- **Multi-structural:** The learner has a grasp on several ideas but doesn't know how they fit together.
- **Relational:** The learner can link, classify, sequence, compare, and contrast their ideas.
- **Extended abstract:** The learner can generalise from their ideas and make predictions about new contexts.

Where Bloom's taxonomy describes actions, the SOLO taxonomy describes how ideas are connected in the mind of a learner.

[The web site Inspiring Inquiry](https://www.inspiringinquiry.com/learningteaching/toolsstrategies/solo-taxonomy) is a very good resource for exploring the SOLO taxonomy in greater depth.

We'll come back to these levels of cognition again and again throughout this book, because Laura uses the SOLO taxonomy in many different areas of her teaching.
For example:

- to interpret the level of questions from students,
- to decide on the appropriate level of answer to provide,
- to choose the scope of a task, and
- to determine expectations of an assessment or a course.
