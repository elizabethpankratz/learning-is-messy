# What is learning?

Learning is a process, a change in cognition.
As educators, we try to facilitate this cognitive process (our focus in [Part 2](../part2/intro-cognitive.qmd) of this book).
But we can't see into learners' minds to know what has actually changed.
All we can access is what learners *do* with what they've learned.
Based on their behaviour, we can only make inferences about their learning (our focus in [Part 3](../part3/intro-behavioural.qmd) of this book).

In very broad terms, learning is the process of building a consistent response to a stimulus.
You know you've learned when you respond to a stimulus in a new and consistent way.

This definition may sound deterministic, as if a learner's response to some stimulus always has to be the same, but this doesn't need to be the case.
For example, different levels of learners may show different kinds of consistent responses.

- A novice learner will have a memorised response to a stimulus.
This response is consistent, but it's not nuanced nor connected to other ideas.
**[EXAMPLE?]**

- An intermediate learner knows that there are nuances behind an idea and connections to be made, but might not be able to convey them precisely.
**[EXAMPLE?]**

- A master learner knows the nuances and connections and chooses the response that's most appropriate given the context.
**[EXAMPLE?]**

Even though these responses all reflect different degrees or levels of cognition, they all still reflect learning.
[On the next page](learning-taxonomies.qmd), we discuss two common ways of conceptualising these different levels of cognition: Bloom's taxonomy and the SOLO taxonomy.
