# Designing multiple choice questions

Easier than student-generated response (but the consequent higher rate of success doesnâ€™t mean students know more!)

The top students should be able to read the stem, have an answer, and go hunting for that answer.

What MC questions are actually testing is the information that the test-taker draws on to choose between the options.

Nod to some item response theory resources on IIC, p diff, etc.
