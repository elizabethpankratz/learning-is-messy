    "text": "Preface\nThis book is a memoir and a manifesto. The content comes from Laura Pankratz’ many years of experience as an educator, and the text is written by Laura’s daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Pankratz.\nWe see learning as a cognitive process with behavioural outcomes. This book is built around these key ideas.\n\nPart 1: What is learning?\nPart 2: The cognitive process of learning, and how to facilitate it\nPart 3: The behavioural outcomes of learning, and how to assess them\n\n\n\nBios\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Pankratz is an educator with more than 30 years of working with students and teachers. One of her principles of education is that learning is messy. Her passion is finding the nugget of value in that mess and then helping the learner to build around it. Laura’s career included teaching grades nine to 12, working with Alberta Education setting the Physics 30 Diploma Examination, two years as Teacher-in-Residence at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and many presentations at science councils across Canada and around the world. She looks forward to learning with participants at every opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Elizabeth Pankratz (personal website) is also an educator. She will soon work as a Lecturer (roughly equivalent to the North American assistant professor) at the University of Edinburgh, where her focus will be helping psychology students build their confidence and skills in statistical analysis. Her favourite moments are when a student overcomes their wariness of statistics and discovers that they’re capable of more than they thought.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nI, Laura, want to thank …\nI, Elizabeth, want to thank Laura! Growing up as Laura’s daughter led me to believe that many aspects of good teaching were simple common sense that everybody knew, but nope—I was just blessed to have an amazing pedagogue for a mother.\n\n\nTo cite this work\nAPA 7:\n\nPankratz, L., & Pankratz, E.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Learning is a process, a change in cognition. As educators, we try to facilitate this cognitive process (our focus in Part 2 of this book). But we can’t see into learners’ minds to know what has actually changed. All we can access is what learners do with what they’ve learned. Based on their behaviour, we can only make inferences about their learning (our focus in Part 3 of this book).\nIn very broad terms, learning can be defined as the process of building a consistent response to a stimulus. You know you’ve learned when you respond to a stimulus in a new and consistent way. And different levels of learners may show different kinds of consistent responses.\n\nA novice learner will have a memorised response to a stimulus. This response is consistent, but it’s not nuanced nor connected to other ideas. [EXAMPLE?]\nAn intermediate learner knows that there are nuances behind an idea and connections to be made, but might not be able to convey them precisely. [EXAMPLE?]\nA master learner knows the nuances and connections and chooses the response that’s most appropriate given the context. [EXAMPLE?]\n\nEven though these responses all reflect different degrees or levels of cognition, they all still reflect learning. On the next page, we discuss two common ways of conceptualising these different levels of cognition: Bloom’s taxonomy and the SOLO taxonomy.",

    "text": "2.1 Bloom’s taxonomy\nProbably the most widespread framework for classifying levels of cognition in learning is Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et al., 1956), more recently refined by Anderson & Krathwohl (2001). Anderson and Krathwohl frame six levels of cognition as actions, here ordered from easiest to most demanding:\nEach of these actions implicates a different degree of cognitive involvement, but they don’t directly describe the kind of connections that the learner is making behind the scenes. For that reason, Laura prefers to work with the SOLO taxonomy.",

    "section": "2.2 The SOLO taxonomy",
    "text": "2.2 The SOLO taxonomy\nSOLO stands for “Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome”. This taxonomy was developed by Biggs & Collis (1982), and it specifies five levels of increasingly complex thinking and understanding:\n\nPre-structural: The learner hasn’t started learning.\nUni-structural: The learner can describe an idea or do a single-step procedure.\nMulti-structural: The learner has a grasp on several ideas but doesn’t know how they fit together.\nRelational: The learner can link, classify, sequence, compare, and contrast their ideas.\nExtended abstract: The learner can generalise from their ideas and make predictions about new contexts.\n\nWhere Bloom’s taxonomy describes actions, the SOLO taxonomy describes how ideas are connected in the mind of a learner.\nThe web site Inspiring Inquiry is a very good resource for exploring the SOLO taxonomy in greater depth.\nWe’ll come back to these levels of cognition again and again throughout this book, because Laura uses the SOLO taxonomy in many different areas of her teaching. For example:\n\nto interpret the level of questions from students,\nto decide on the appropriate level of answer to provide,\nto choose the scope of a task, and\nto determine expectations of an assessment or a course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnderson, L.

    "text": "Learning is messy—it’s only performance that’s clean.\nWithin the mess of a learner’s developing understanding, there will be always a nugget of something valuable. It is the teacher’s task to find that nugget and build on it.\nBut, crucially: the aspects of a learner’s developing understanding that are not worth building on are not “wrong” or “mistakes”. If the student hasn’t learned the material yet, then even if they produce something incorrect, they are not “making a mistake”.\nSomething can only be a mistake if the person knows better. So during the learning process, the learner can make no mistakes, because they don’t yet know better. Something that might be wrong as a final answer is not wrong while the student is still learning.\nLearners must be allowed to explore ideas and experience the process of learning without their attempts being described—by themselves or by their teachers—as wrong. “Wrong” is a judgement, an evaluation, and it does not belong in the vocabulary of students or teachers during the process of learning.\n(And as we’ll discuss in Part 3, when the time does come to assess students’ performance, evaluations should be phrased more constructively than “this is wrong”!)",

    "text": "It is easier to remain in the same state than to change. Since learning is change, learning is hard work.\nWe must keep this in mind when we design courses and individual teaching sessions (see Chapter 7). A teacher can max out students’ cognitive load by covering too much material in a single session. And maxed-out students may be less willing to trust this teacher and thus less willing to take risks (see Chapter 6).\nWe must also keep in mind that learning is hard work when we introduce new information that conflicts with old information. Take, for example, the grade 11 physics curriculum in Alberta. Before grade 11, students had been learning about physical systems in terms of friction. But grade 11 brings a paradigm shift: systems are now described without friction. [CORRECTNESS/PHRASING?]\nTo successfully make this switch, students need to update their worldview and develop a new common sense. But this takes lots of energy! In Laura’s experience, students struggle to integrate information that goes against what they had learned before. Students ask things like, “Do you want me to tell you what I think, or what you told me yesterday?”\nQuestions like this indicate superficial learning: independent bits are kluged on to one another, and little attempt is made to modify one’s existing understanding. Laura likens the behaviour to a hermit crab: what changes is the shell, not what’s inside.\nTo foreshadow Chapter 5: How do we help students update their worldviews in light of new, conflicting information?\nWe prompt students to make predictions, and let their predictions fail.\nPredictions reveal what students believe about how a system works. To produce a prediction, students need to recognise and commit to those beliefs. And they see that their belief needs to be modified if their prediction falls flat. The prediction activity is valuable because learners must recognise and commit to their beliefs to be able to actively modify them.\nMaking and evaluating predictions is one kind of “learning by doing”. In the next chapter, we explore more activities that help students learn.",
