    "text": "Preface\nThis book is a memoir and a manifesto. The content comes from Laura Pankratz’ many years of experience as an educator, and the text is written by Laura’s daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Pankratz.\nWe see learning as a cognitive process with behavioural outcomes. This book is built around these key ideas.\n\nPart 1: What is learning?\nPart 2: The cognitive process of learning, and how to facilitate it\nPart 3: The behavioural outcomes of learning, and how to assess them\n\n\n\nBios\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Pankratz is an educator with more than 30 years of working with students and teachers. One of her principles of education is that learning is messy. Her passion is finding the nugget of value in that mess and then helping the learner to build around it. Laura’s career included teaching grades nine to 12, working with Alberta Education setting the Physics 30 Diploma Examination, two years as Teacher-in-Residence at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and many presentations at science councils across Canada and around the world. She looks forward to learning with participants at every opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Elizabeth Pankratz (personal website) is also an educator. She will soon work as a Lecturer (roughly equivalent to the North American assistant professor) at the University of Edinburgh, where her focus will be helping psychology students build their confidence and skills in statistical analysis. Her favourite moments are when a student overcomes their wariness of statistics and discovers that they’re capable of more than they thought.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nI, Laura, want to thank …\nI, Elizabeth, want to thank Laura! Growing up as Laura’s daughter led me to believe that many aspects of good teaching were simple common sense that everybody knew, but nope—I was just blessed to have an amazing pedagogue for a mother.\n\n\nTo cite this work\nAPA 7:\n\nPankratz, L., & Pankratz, E.
