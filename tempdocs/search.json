    "text": "Preface\nThis book is a memoir and a manifesto. The content comes from Laura Pankratz’ many years of experience as an educator, and the text is written by Laura’s daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Pankratz.\nWe see learning as a cognitive process with behavioural outcomes. This book is built around these key ideas.\n\nPart 1: What is learning?\nPart 2: The cognitive process of learning, and how to facilitate it\nPart 3: The behavioural outcomes of learning, and how to assess them\n\n\n\nBios\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Pankratz is an educator with more than 30 years of working with students and teachers. One of her principles of education is that learning is messy. Her passion is finding the nugget of value in that mess and then helping the learner to build around it. Laura’s career included teaching grades nine to 12, working with Alberta Education setting the Physics 30 Diploma Examination, two years as Teacher-in-Residence at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and many presentations at science councils across Canada and around the world. She looks forward to learning with participants at every opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Elizabeth Pankratz (personal website) is also an educator. She will soon work as a Lecturer (roughly equivalent to the North American assistant professor) at the University of Edinburgh, where her focus will be helping psychology students build their confidence and skills in statistical analysis. Her favourite moments are when a student overcomes their wariness of statistics and discovers that they’re capable of more than they thought.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nI, Laura, want to thank …\nI, Elizabeth, want to thank Laura! Growing up as Laura’s daughter led me to believe that many aspects of good teaching were simple common sense that everybody knew, but nope—I was just blessed to have an amazing pedagogue for a mother.\n\n\nTo cite this work\nAPA 7:\n\nPankratz, L., & Pankratz, E.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Learning is a process, a change in cognition. As educators, we try to facilitate this cognitive process (our focus in Part 2 of this book). But we can’t see into learners’ minds to know what has actually changed. All we can access is what learners do with what they’ve learned. Based on their behaviour, we make inferences about their learning (our focus in Part 3 of this book).\nIn very broad terms, learning can be defined as the process of building a consistent response to a stimulus. You know you’ve learned when you respond to a stimulus in a new and consistent way. And different levels of learners may show different kinds of consistent responses.\n\nA novice learner will have a memorised response to a stimulus. This response is consistent, but it’s not nuanced nor connected to other ideas. When faced with a new context, the novice learner might say something like, “You’ve not taught me how to answer this,” or “I don’t know where to begin.”\nAn intermediate learner knows that there are nuances behind an idea and connections to be made, but might not be able to convey them precisely. When faced with a new context, the intermediate learner might give responses at a simpler level of cognition than what the new context demands (we’ll talk more about levels of cognition on the next page), or they might say something like, “I’ve memorised everything, but I still don’t understand!”\nA master learner knows the nuances and connections and chooses the response that’s most appropriate in each situation. When faced with a new context, a master learner recognises what parts of their understanding are transferrable and is able to situate them in the new scenario.\n\nEven though these responses all reflect different degrees or levels of cognition, they all still reflect learning. On the next page, we discuss two common ways of conceptualising these different levels of cognition: Bloom’s taxonomy and the SOLO taxonomy.",

    "text": "2.1 Bloom’s taxonomy\nProbably the most widespread framework for classifying levels of cognition in learning is Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et al., 1956), more recently refined by Anderson & Krathwohl (2001). Anderson and Krathwohl frame six levels of cognition as actions, here ordered from easiest to most demanding:\nTo use Bloom’s taxonomy, educators need to interpret these six levels and map them to what they infer a student is actually doing when the student generates a response.\nIn Laura’s experience, different educators interpret these levels differently, leading to people using the same words for different concepts (and different words for the same concepts). For this reason, she prefers the SOLO taxonomy. It is easier to explain, internalise, and use.",

    "section": "2.2 The SOLO taxonomy",
    "text": "2.2 The SOLO taxonomy\nSOLO stands for “Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome”. This taxonomy was developed by Biggs & Collis (1982), and it specifies five levels of increasingly complex thinking and understanding:\n\nPre-structural: The learner hasn’t started learning.\nUni-structural: The learner can describe an idea or do a single-step procedure.\nMulti-structural: The learner has a grasp on several distinct ideas but doesn’t know how they fit together.\nRelational: The learner can link, classify, sequence, compare, and contrast their ideas.\nExtended abstract: The learner can generalise from their ideas and make predictions about new contexts.\n\nSOLO’s major strength is that it describes relationships among ideas, rather than Bloom’s approach of classifying actions. And relationships among ideas are crucial for our work as educators: we must always be aware of the way students are linking (or not yet linking) their ideas.\nWe’ll come back to these levels of cognition again and again throughout this book, because Laura uses the SOLO taxonomy in many different areas of her teaching. For example:\n\nto interpret the cognitive level of questions from students,\nto decide on the appropriate level of answer to provide,\nto evaluate the level of a student’s answer compared to the level expected by the question,\nto choose the scope of a task, and\nto determine expectations of an assessment or a course.\n\nThe web site Inspiring Inquiry is a very good resource for exploring the SOLO taxonomy in greater depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnderson, L.

    "text": "Learning is messy—it’s only performance that’s clean.\nWithin the mess of a learner’s developing understanding, there will be always a nugget of something valuable. It is the teacher’s task to find that nugget and build on it.\nBut, crucially: the aspects of a learner’s developing understanding that are not worth building on are not “wrong” or “mistakes”. If the student hasn’t learned the material yet, then even if they produce something incorrect, they are not “making a mistake”.\nSomething can only be a mistake if the person knows better. So during the learning process, the learner can make no mistakes, because they don’t yet know better. Something that might be wrong as a final answer is not wrong while the student is still learning.\nLearners must be allowed to explore ideas and experience the process of learning without their attempts being described—by themselves or by their teachers—as wrong. “Wrong” is a judgement, an evaluation, and it does not belong in the vocabulary of students or teachers during the process of learning.\n(And as we’ll discuss in Part 3, when the time does come to assess students’ performance, evaluations should be phrased more constructively than “this is wrong”!)",

    "text": "It is easier to remain in the same state than to change. Since learning is change, learning is hard work.\nWe must keep this in mind when we design courses and individual teaching sessions (see Chapter 7). A teacher can max out students’ cognitive load by covering too much material in a single session. And maxed-out students may be less willing to trust this teacher and thus less willing to take risks (see Chapter 6).\nWe must also keep in mind that learning is hard work when we introduce new information that conflicts with old information. Take, for example, the grade 11 physics curriculum in Alberta. Before grade 11, students had been learning about physical systems in terms of friction. But grade 11 brings a paradigm shift: systems are now described without friction. [CORRECTNESS/PHRASING?]\nTo successfully make this switch, students need to update their worldview and develop a new common sense. But this takes lots of energy! In Laura’s experience, students struggle to integrate information that goes against what they had learned before. Students ask things like, “Do you want me to tell you what I think, or what you told me yesterday?”\nQuestions like this indicate superficial learning: independent bits are kluged on to one another, and little attempt is made to modify one’s existing understanding. Laura likens the behaviour to a hermit crab: what changes is the shell, not what’s inside.\nTo foreshadow Chapter 5: How do we help students update their worldviews in light of new, conflicting information?\nWe prompt students to make predictions, and let their predictions fail.\nPredictions reveal what students believe about how a system works. To produce a prediction, students need to recognise and commit to those beliefs. And they see that their belief needs to be modified if their prediction falls flat. The prediction activity is valuable because learners must recognise and commit to their beliefs to be able to actively modify them.\nMaking and evaluating predictions is one kind of “learning by doing”. In the next chapter, we explore more activities that help students learn.",

This way, teachers and students can finish up with one topic, close that box, and move on to the next one. This practice is sometimes called siloing.\nThough it’s common, siloing is not good practice. With each topic handled separately, learners cannot forge robust connections between ideas and build out their mental network of conceptual links—one of the most important tasks in deepening their understanding (Ambrose et al., 2010; Biggs & Collis, 1982). Keeping each topic’s box open is a harder cognitive task, but it’s a better education.\nTo avoid siloing, two methods that teachers can use are interleaving material and what Laura calls Velcro teaching.",

    "text": "5.2 More ideas\n\nLaura has observed that attention and cognition is improved for about ten minutes following physical activity. So to engage this boost, ask students to move—for example, by voting on a prompt by moving to the four corners of the room.\nAsking students to improve an existing response is a useful activity for prompting meta-cognition. If the example response was produced by the teacher, though, then the activity is less effective than if the example response comes from a student. Starting with the teacher’s response may make students feel like the response is already above their level and that they’ll never be that good. (Food for thought: what about an example response produced by a large language model?)\nVoting:\n\nVoting activities are good for quicker thinkers and less kind to slower thinkers. To give slower thinkers time to catch up, consider modifying the format to give some pre-vote thinking time or using the format of Think–Pair–Share.\nAllow students to change their vote, to model the process of learning.\n\nPeer interaction:\n\nStudents learn better from one another than they learn from us (Tullis & Goldstone, 2020). But peer instruction especially improves the learning of the top students, in Laura’s experience, because the top students have the chance to explain a concept to somebody else—and explaining things deepens understanding. To make sure that struggling students still benefit from peer instruction, be transparent about how it will benefit them: for example, that they’ll be exposed to the concept explained in a different way.\nWhen students are asking one another questions, listen in:\n\nWhat is the cognitive level of the questions they’re asking? (See SOLO taxonomy.)\nWhat type of challenge is the student trying to address?\nIs their question in line with the kind of thinking you were aiming to provoke?\n\nDuring peer interaction, can prompt them with certain questions to model active listening, for example:\n\nDo you agree with X response?\nHow would you improve that response?\nWhat else could we consider?\nWas X response better than Y response?\nWhat did Y response add to X?\nWhat else could we add?\n… and so on.\n\n\nA flipped classroom (where students prepare the material on their own time and the synchronous gatherings are for advancing students’ thinking) requires that students buy in and show their own initiative.",

It demands from them little effort and moreover, when the material is presented clearly, students may have the illusion of understanding, the illusion of mastery. And on the other hand, active learning takes hard work that can feel to many students like it’s not paying off. However, they shouldn’t put too much stock in this feeling. Research has shown that, even if students feel like they’re learning less, active engagement actually improves learning and long-term retention (Brown et al., 2014; Deslauriers et al., 2019). Encourage students by sharing these findings.\nStudents may also resist active learning because it often means taking a risk (because learning is messy!). And if students aren’t willing to take risks, this could reflect that they don’t have enough trust in the teacher: trust that they can accomplish whatever task the teacher has set for them, and trust that the teacher will receive whatever they produce with respect. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss in more detail the relationship between student and teacher, including building this trust.\n\n\n\n\nBrown, P. C., Roediger, H. L., & McDaniel, M. A. (2014).

A question is evidence that they’re following along and that they’re willing to take a risk.\nWe can learn a lot about where a student is at by analysing the kinds of questions they ask. What cognitive level is the student trying to use? What is their attitude toward risk? What’s their resilience like?\nEven a hugely broad question like “What should I do? I don’t know where to start” tells you, for example, that the student wants a memorised, known, algorithmic method to apply that will always work. If memorising algorithms is the goal of the course, then giving exactly that kind of guidance is appropriate. But if that’s not the goal of the course, then this becomes an opportunity to guide the student toward the answer. In general, when a student asks for help, try not to tell.

    "text": "6.4 Socratic questioning\nStudents find Socratic questioning very annoying, but it is very effective. Socratic questions aren’t just any questions directed toward the student: “Why did you do that?” is not a Socratic question. Rather, Socratic questions aim to prompt metacognition.\nA good starting point is “Can you walk me through your thinking so far?” By going step by step through their thinking, students will often identify their own missteps. It’s great when students do this because the teacher doesn’t need to point out where the misunderstanding was–the student has done the metacognitive troubleshooting themselves and has gained an effective strategy for their toolkit.\nA good strategy for Socratic questioning is to start at the lowest cognitive level in the SOLO taxonomy, then if the student meets you at that level, ramp up the complexity. Start with uni-structural questions to check whether students understand individual ideas (e.g., “Can you tell me about X?”). If they do, then progress to multi-structural and relational questions, guiding the student to connect their ideas in the target direction (e.g., “Why do you think X is happening?”, “What’s one way X is related to Y?”)",

    "text": "6.6 Ask questions intentionally\nEvery question you ask (and indeed, every task and activity you set) should have a clear intention, purpose, or goal. You should know what your question is trying to accomplish, so that you can judge whether the aim has been met.\nFor example, you might ask questions for the following reasons:\n\nAs a management strategy: to wake students up, to get them on task, to redirect a behaviour.\nTo gauge the level understanding in the class.\n\nBest to target these questions not toward the top students, but toward students at about the 80th percentile. Their understanding is more likely representative of the class overall.\nDon’t ask “Are there any questions?”, but “At this point, what questions do you have?”\nDon’t ask “Do you understand?”, but “What’s next?” or “In this situation, what would you do?” (People don’t like admitting to not understanding.)\n\nVery broadly: to gain information that the teacher (and potentially the students) didn’t previously have.\n\nBy responding to student questions in a particular way, you can make students an authority in the classroom too. Specifically, you can allow students to thoroughly answer questions and then just move on to the next idea, not restating what the student already said. Doing this signals to other students that knowledge can come not just from the teacher but also from their peers. It changes the role of student and teacher in the classroom, and it unnerves students who expect to get all their information from the teacher. However, learning from their peers is an important skill for students to develop, and this is one way to encourage it.",

But if you ask a relational question and they give you a uni-structural answer, then don’t fall prey to confirmation bias (more below)—double down and clarify what kind of response you wanted from them.\nAim to ask students questions that are in their ballpark, that are roughly at their level of ability. There’s no point asking someone who’s already struggling a very challenging question. But be aware of internalised biases in terms of whom you assume to be operating at particular cognitive levels (İnan-Kaya & Rubie-Davies, 2022).\nIn fact, it’s very useful to tell students about the SOLO taxonomy, tell them that there are different levels of cognition that we’re applying. If students are familiar with these cognitive levels, a very handy metacognitive level of conversation opens up. For example, you can say, “I’m about to ask you a relational question”, and the student might say, “OK, but I might only give you a uni-structural response”. This is great, because the student has understood what’s being asked and what cognitive level they’re at! Even better when the students can articulate, say, “I have a multi-structural level of understanding but I want a relational one”. We want students to be able to manage their own learning, and this is one useful way.\nAdditionally, telling people what level of cognition you want from them will change the way they approach a question (Kahnemann, 2011). Even without using the SOLO terminology, you might say something like, “I’m going to ask a question that requires you to think, so I’m not going to take the first answer.” And telling students up front that you want them to think will make them more likely to engage more complex levels of cognition.",

You might set the hook forward (“next week, we’ll hear more about X”), and if you do, you’ll have to deliver (“like I promised last week, we’re going to talk more about X”). We’ve been setting hooks in this text, too, every time we say “We’ll talk more about X in Chapter Y”. For example, in Chapter 2 when we set the hook forward about all the places the SOLO taxonomy will reappear throughout this text.\nVelcro teaching requires that you know your material at least a week ahead of time, and that you also have a solid understanding of how the topics in your course fit together. This level of understanding can be difficult to attain the first couple times through a course. Give yourself grace! Sometimes just making it through the week is enough.\nBut the goal of velcro teaching is to help students keep the boxes of each topic open and to prepare them for making the connections that you think are important.",

Telling people what to expect before they experience it is called “pre-organising”, and novice learners and the average person much prefer pre-organised tasks. So telling students what is to come can help get them on board. (“Post-organising”—giving people an experience and then putting a structure over it in retrospect—is better-suited for more masterful learners, because they’re more comfortable juggling several live ideas at a time.)\nTransparency about structure also applies at the level of an individual lesson. At the beginning of a lesson, give students an outline of what they can expect from that session, and importantly, check off topics from the outline as they’re accomplished. The goal is for everybody to be able to tell where they are in the day’s schedule, even if (when) their attention falters. People should always be able to find a way back in.\n\n\n\n\nAmbrose, S.
