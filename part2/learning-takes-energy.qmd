# Learning takes energy

It is easier to remain in the same state than to change.
Since learning is change, learning is hard work.

We must keep this in mind when we design courses and individual teaching sessions (see [Chapter 7](designing-course.qmd)).
A teacher can max out students' cognitive load by covering too much material in a single session.
And maxed-out students may be less willing to trust this teacher and thus less willing to take risks (see [Chapter 6](interact-w-students.qmd)).

We must also keep in mind that learning is hard work when we introduce new information that conflicts with old information.
Take, for example, the grade 11 physics curriculum in Alberta.
Before grade 11, students had been learning about physical systems in terms of friction. 
But grade 11 brings a paradigm shift: systems are now described without friction. **[CORRECTNESS/PHRASING?]**

To successfully make this switch, students need to update their worldview and develop a new common sense.
But this takes lots of energy!
In Laura's experience, students struggle to integrate information that goes against what they had learned before.
Students ask things like, "Do you want me to tell you what I think, or what you told me yesterday?"

Questions like this indicate superficial learning: independent bits are kluged on to one another, and little attempt is made to modify one's existing understanding.
Laura likens the behaviour to a hermit crab: what changes is the shell, not what's inside.

To foreshadow [Chapter 5](learning-by-doing.qmd): How do we help students update their worldviews in light of new, conflicting information?

We prompt students to make predictions, and let their predictions fail.

Predictions reveal what students believe about how a system works.
To produce a prediction, students need to recognise and commit to those beliefs.
And they see that their belief needs to be modified if their prediction falls flat.
The prediction activity is valuable because learners must recognise and commit to their beliefs to be able to actively modify them.

Making and evaluating predictions is one kind of "learning by doing".
[In the next chapter](learning-by-doing.qmd), we explore more activities that help students learn.
