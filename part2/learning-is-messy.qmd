# Learning is messy {#sec-learning-is-messy}

A key idea in Laura's teaching philosophy is that learning is messy.
But within the mess of a learner's developing understanding will always be a nugget of something valuable.
The teacher's task is to find that nugget and build on it.

Another key idea: the parts of a learner's developing understanding that *aren't* worth building on should not be thought of as "wrong" or as "mistakes".

If the student hasn't learned the material yet, they cannot make a mistake.
Something is only a mistake if the learner knows better.
Something that might be wrong at performance time, when given as a final answer, is not wrong while someone is still learning.

Learners must be allowed to explore ideas and take risks without their attempts being described—by themselves or by their teachers—as wrong.
"Wrong" is a judgement, an evaluation, and it does not belong within the process of learning.
(And as we'll discuss in [Part 3](../part3/more-than-grades.qmd), when the time does come to assess students' performance, it's important to phrase our evaluations much more constructively than "this is wrong"!)
