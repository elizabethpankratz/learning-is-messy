# Designing a course

[In the last chapter](interact-w-students.qmd), we advised you to know the purpose of every question you ask.
The same principle holds at the level of course design: know the purpose of every piece of material you incorporate.

Students should have good, real reasons to learn the material.
And once you've chosen your material intentionally, students can grouse, "Why should I learn this?" and you will have a good answer.
("Because you need it for the test" should never pass your lips!)


## Breaking down silos

It is common practice to structure a course such that every topic receives its own little box, tidily compartmentalised away from the other boxes.
This way, teachers and students can finish up with one topic, close that box, and move on to the next one.
This practice is sometimes called siloing.

Though it's common practice, siloing is not *good* practice.
With each topic handled separately, learners cannot forge robust connections between ideas and build out their mental network of conceptual linksâ€”one of the most important tasks in deepening their understanding [@AmbroseEtAl2010; @BiggsCollis1982].
Keeping each topic's box open is a harder cognitive task, but it's a better education.

To avoid siloing, two methods that teachers can use are interleaving material and what Laura calls Velcro teaching.


### Interleaving

Interleaving refers to switching between topics within some span of time, rather than focusing only on one topic and then moving on to the next.

Unlike a silo structure such as

- Day 1: Topic A
- Day 2: Topic A
- Day 3: Topic B
- Day 4: Topic B,

an interleaved structure might be

- Day 1: Topic A
- Day 2: Topic B
- Day 3: Topic A
- Day 4: Topic B.

Returning to Topic A after Topic B has been broached invites learners to draw connections between A and B that they may otherwise have missed.

Interleaving has been shown to strengthen learning and aid retention [@BrownEtAl2014].
