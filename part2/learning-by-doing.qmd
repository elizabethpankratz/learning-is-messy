# Learning happens by doing

When students engage actively with the material, they have the opportunity to learn.

Passive lectures produce (at best) passive learning, the way that millions of people watch NHL hockey without becoming professional hockey players.

The more active the engagement, the better.
Filling in the blanks in a lecture handout or marking up printed-out slideshows may be better than nothing, but neither truly counts as "active".
Even typing notes has been shown to produce lower recall and retention than writing notes by hand [@SmokerEtAl2009; @MangenEtAl2015].
Because typing proceeds faster and fills unlimited space, it may demand less synthesis in the moment than writing by hand, which is limited by time and by space.

## Tools for Teaching Science

Many of Laura's favourite instructional tools and classroom activities can be found in the free resource [Tools for Teaching Science](https://resources.perimeterinstitute.ca/products/tools-for-teaching-science), which Laura co-authored with Sean Jackson at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in 2020. **[NAME OTHER CONTRIBUTORS?]**

Valuable activities in [Tools for Teaching Science]((https://resources.perimeterinstitute.ca/products/tools-for-teaching-science)) include:

- Jigsaws (a structure for lively group work)
- Predict, Explain, Observe, Explain (PEOE)
- Many formats of student voting


## More ideas

- Laura has observed that attention and cognition is improved for about ten minutes following physical activity.
So to engage this boost, ask students to move—for example, by voting on a prompt by moving to the four corners of the room.

- Asking students to improve an existing response is a useful activity for prompting meta-cognition.
If the example response was produced by the teacher, though, then the activity is less effective than if the example response comes from a student.
Starting with the teacher's response may make students feel like the response is already above their level and that they'll never be that good.
(Food for thought: what about an example response produced by a large language model?)

- Voting:
  - Voting activities are good for quicker thinkers and less kind to slower thinkers.
    To give slower thinkers time to catch up, consider modifying the format to give some pre-vote thinking time or using the format of Think–Pair–Share.
  - Allow students to change their vote, to model the process of learning.

- Encourage peer interaction:
  - a
  - b




## If students don't want to engage

- hard work, and feels like it's not paying off, but does lead to more robust long-term learning than what feels quick and easy [@BrownEtAl2014].

- flipped classroom requires buy-in

- trust
