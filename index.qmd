# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is a memoir and a manifesto.
The content comes from Laura Pankratz' many years of experience as an educator, and the text is written by Laura's daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Pankratz.

We see learning as a cognitive process with behavioural outcomes.
This book is built around these key ideas.

- Part 1: [What is learning?](part1/intro-learning.qmd)
- Part 2: [The cognitive process of learning, and how to facilitate it](part2/learning-is-messy.qmd)
- Part 3: [The behavioural outcomes of learning, and how to assess them](part3/more-than-grades.qmd)

**Laura Pankratz** is an educator with more than 30 years of working with students and teachers.
One of her principles of education is that learning is messy. 
Her passion is finding the nugget of value in that mess and then helping the learner to build around it. 
Laura's career included teaching grades nine to 12, working with Alberta Education setting the Physics 30 Diploma Examination, two years as Teacher-in-Residence at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and many presentations at science councils across Canada and around the world. 
She looks forward to learning with participants at every opportunity.

**Dr. Elizabeth Pankratz** ([personal website](https://elizabethpankratz.github.io)) is also an educator, a Lecturer (assistant professor) at the University of Edinburgh.
Her work focuses on helping Psychology students build their confidence and skills in statistical analysis.
Her favourite moments are when a student overcomes their wariness of statistics and discovers that they're capable of more than they thought.

# Laura's acknowledgements

My ideas have formed as a result of conversations with excellent educators, workshops I have attended or presented, and years in high school classrooms or in assessment.
	
Listing names means someone wonâ€™t get mentioned who should, and if that is you please extend grace! 

I have deep and abiding appreciation for Jack, Steve, Jeff, Dion, Kristian, Erin, Jason, Shane, Stan, Shannon, Bill, Dave 1, Dave 2, and Lawrence. 

For the dear friends who have listened to endless rants about education or who have engaged in their own rants, much love to Al and Kristina. 

Separate mention of my two years as Teacher-in-Residence and the more than 10 years as a teacher network regional coordinator for the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics is necessary.
The opportunity to work with teachers across Canada and around the world who are passionate about student learning provided me with energy and an outlet for my needs to learn and to help others learn.
The people here include Greg, Dave, Kelly, Damian, Sean, Saara, Simon, Nanouk, and Philip. 
	
Thank you, ALL, for your years of support, friendship, and professionally challenging conversations.
